## Class 1 - Introduction to Machine Learning

### ISLP Chapter 1 
  - What is machine learning?
  - Supervised (wage data regression, stock market direction classification) vs. Unsupervised (gene expressino clustering)

### ISLP Chapter 2
  - Dataset terminology
  - $y=f(x)+\epsilon$
  - Why estimate $f$?
  - Prediction: Predictive error, lower bound $\mathbb{V}[\epsilon]$
  - Inference: ...
  - Modeling: How do we estimate $f$? Parametric vs nonparametric
  - The Trade-Off Between Prediction Accuracy and Model Interpretability
  - &sect;2.2 Assessing Model Accuracy
    - Quality of fit vs. predictive accuracy
    - Bias-variance tradeoff for mean-squared error
    - Assessing classifiers: Bayes classifier
